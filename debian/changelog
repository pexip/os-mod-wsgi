mod-wsgi (2.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #496067). This upload covers the changes of
    mod-wsgi 2.2 and 2.3.
    mod-wsgi 2.2 is mainly bugfix-releases. The only exception is a backport
    of one function from 3.0 which allows the setting of process names on *BSD
    - this does not affect Linux.
    mod-wsgi 2.3 fixes regressions which were introduced in 2.2.
    
    Here follows a list of the bugfixes in 2.2:
      1. Fix bug whereby if mod_python is loaded at same time as mod_wsgi the
         WSGIImportScript directive can cause Apache child processes to crash.
         For details see: http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/issues/detail?id=91

      2. Fix bug where mod_wsgi daemon process startup could fail due to old
         stale UNIX listener socket file as described in:
         http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/issues/detail?id=77 

      3. Fix bug where listener socket file descriptors for daemon processes
         were being leaked in Apache parent process on a graceful restart.
         Also fixes problem where UNIX listener socket was left in filesystem
         on both graceful restart and graceful shutdown. For details see:
         http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/issues/detail?id=95 

      4. Fix bug where response was truncated when a null character appeared
         as first character in block of data being returned from
         wsgi.file_wrapper.
         Only occurred when code fell back to using iteration over supplied
         file like object, rather than optimised method such as sendfile().
         http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/issues/detail?id=100

    The following regressions/bugs of 2.2 were fixed in 2.3:

      1. Fixed problem introduced in version 2.2 of mod_wsgi whereby use of
         daemon mode would cause CGI scripts to fail. It is quite possible
         that the bug could also have caused failures with other Apache
         modules that relied on registering of cleanup functions against
         Apache configuration memory pool.

      2. (does not affect Linux)
         When using setproctitle() on BSD systems, first argument should be
         a printf style format string with values to fill out per format as
         additional arguments. Code was supplying value to be displayed as
         format string which meant that if it contained any printf type format
         sequences, could cause process to crash as corresponding arguments
         wouldn't have ben provided.

mod-wsgi (2.1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Calling pyversions in postinst requires that 'python' is installed *and*
    configured, so it would need to be added to Pre-Depends. As this is kinda
    ugly, we ship the symlink to the module for the right Python version now
    in the package. I assume that this will really fix #483197 now, I'm quite
    sure that the broken link results from an error message of the
    unconfigured python/pyversions. Shipping the symlink also makes sure that
    it is available while Apache is configured (which may happen before
    mod-wsgi is configured). (Closes: #483197, #491478)
  * Drop the parts from the maintainer scripts which renamed the wsgi config
    files (see #456737 for details) - as mod-wsgi was not released with Etch
    and the fix was for a long enough time in testing, it should be safe to
    remove them before Lenny.

      Tomasek for the report. (Closes: #488982)

      stack-size option need to be set due to this change.
